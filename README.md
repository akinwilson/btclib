## Overview 
Implementation of bitcoin library in python allowing for private and public key generation, transaction creation, signing, verifying and broadcasting along with a wallet implementation.

Note: this implementation has not been optimised for speed. Anywhere that requires randomness, a dedicated piece of hardware for the purpose of true random number generation is recommended to be used. The pseudo random numbers generated by programs are just that; pseudo random, and can be predicted given enough architectural factors are known.

See True random number generators for more information on the subject.
## Usage 
For programmatic use 
```python 
from btclib.wallet import Wallet 

# reload a wallet 
wallet = Wallet.from_path()
# generate a new wallet 
wallet = Wallet.new()
# update transcation information 
wallet.update()
# transfer funds 
wallet.send()
```
for use via the CLI 
```bash 
btclib --new-wallet 'cold wallet'
btclib --wallet 'cold wallet' --balance 
```

And there will hopefully also be a desktop application to accompany this repositories for those that are not comfortable with either the CLI or `python`. 


## Running tests 
To run tests locally, install the developer requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```
then, with
```
python -m pytest
```
you can run the tests locally.

## Further improvements 

As well as programmatically interacting with the wallet, it would be more user friendly and made accessible to a wider audience if a desktop application is developed to allow interfacing with the wallet through a graphical user interface.
