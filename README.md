## Overview 
Implementation of bitcoin library in python allowing for private and public key generation, transaction creation, signing, verifying and broadcasting along with a wallet implementation.

Note: this implementation has not been optimised for speed. Anywhere that requires randomness, a dedicated piece of hardware for the purpose of true random number generation is recommended to be used. The pseudo random numbers generated by programs are just that; pseudo random, and can be predicted given enough architectural factors are known.

See True random number generators for more information on the subject.
